# GitHub Archive Program & Arctic Code Vault

This repository contains materials for the GitHub Archive Program.

## About the Guide to the GitHub Code Vault

The Guide to the GitHub Code Vault is included at the beginning of each of the 186 hardened film reels used to archive every active public GitHub repository as of **February 2, 2020**. We encourage the community to propose improvements by submitting pull requests for additions, deletions, or edits for future iterations of the guide.

### Available Translations

- Farsi
- French
- Greek
- German
- Indonesian
- Italian
- Malayalam

- Portuguese
- Punjabi
- Russian

While GitHub cannot take responsibility for these translations, they provide valuable support in explaining the Guide and the broader Archive Program. Community translations are available in the `Community Guides` directory of this repository.

## Tech Tree Resources

The Tech Tree is inspired by the Long Now Foundation's Manual for Civilization. It documents the technological layers supporting modern open-source software and includes additional cultural context for the Arctic Code Vault. Contributions to the Tech Tree are welcome.
